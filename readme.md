Required software
=================

-   [Haskell GHC compiler and Cabal build
    tool](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/#minimal)

Build instructions
==================

Windows (untested)
------------------

Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

``` {.bash}
cabal run build
```

Linux instructions
------------------

Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

``` {.bash}
cabal run build
```

or, with GNU Make:

``` {.bash}
make
```

This should also probably work on OSX, but I haven\'t tested it.
