* Required software
  - [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][Haskell Stack]]

* Build instructions
** Windows (untested)

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     stack build && stack exec build
   #+END_SRC

** Linux instructions

   Clone this repository, enter directory, and run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     stack build && stack exec build
   #+END_SRC

   or, with GNU Make:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     make
   #+END_SRC

   This should also probably work on OSX, but I haven't tested it.
